# FinBERT-Analysis-Study

### Focus of Study
This paper looks at the NLP task of Sentiment
Analysis, specifically within the domain of Finance. The task involves taking a look at a variety of financial information sources such as news
articles, financial statements of a company, and
social media to predict the sentiment associated
with a given security. The sentiment is classified
into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. These classifications on financial texts provide insights into public perception of a particular
security and helps determine whether investors are
likely to buy, hold, or sell that security. Financial
sentiment analysis is thus crucial in forecasting the
direction a security might take which is why this
problem is so important.

In this Analysis Study, I evaluate FinBERT, a
language model based on BERT and fine-tuned for
NLP tasks in the financial domain. FinBERT was
chosen due to its specialized fine-tuning on financial texts, which allows the model to understand
the finance specific terminology that are present
in financial texts better than general-purpose language models. Previous studies have demonstrated how FinBERTâ€™s performance in financial
sentiment analysis exceeds the performance of
other models, making it a suitable choice for this
particular analysis study
