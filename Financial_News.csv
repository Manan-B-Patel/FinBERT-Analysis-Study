Adjusted net loss1 from continuing operations was US$34.7 million or US$1.07 per diluted share, compared to US$66.8 million or US$2.06 per diluted share a year ago. Last year’s third quarter loss included US$61.7 million, or US$1.90 per diluted share as the result of an unfavourable tax assessment.Nine-month revenue from continuing operations was US$1.23 billion, a decrease of 7.1% compared to US$1.32 billion last year.

This coupled with the U.S. dollar strengthening even more in the third quarter were the two biggest drivers of our underperformance. Further, consumers in Europe are much more cautious due to the continued instability abroad and the particularly acute fall in the value of the Euro and Pound Sterling. As we move forward, our focus for the balance of the year will be to drive sales to reduce inventories and generate cash to prepare for 2023 where we anticipate lower input costs and a return to more normal ordering levels,” stated Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz.  ",Dorel Reports Third Quarter 2022 Results,"Dorel Reports Third Quarter 2022 Results --  Dorel Industries Inc.
